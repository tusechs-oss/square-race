## A utility class for evaluating validation conditions and collecting error messages.
## This class provides a static method to evaluate a list of ValidationCondition instances
## Used by Godot Doctor to check for various conditions in a Godot project.
class_name GodotDoctor

## and returns a PackedStringArray of error messages for those that fail.
